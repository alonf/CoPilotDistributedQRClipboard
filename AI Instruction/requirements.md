# Requirements - Distributed QR Clipboard System

## Project Overview
A web-based shared clipboard system using ASP.NET 9 Minimal API and C# 13 that allows multiple devices to share clipboard content through QR code joining.

## User Stories

### 1. Session Creation and QR Code Generation
**As a** user  
**I want** to visit the web page and automatically get a unique session  
**So that** I can share clipboard content with other devices  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] On page load, a unique session ID is automatically generated
- [ ] A QR code is displayed containing the session join URL
- [ ] The session ID is at least 16 characters long and cryptographically secure
- [ ] The QR code is clearly visible and scannable
- [ ] The session remains active for a reasonable duration (e.g., 24 hours)

### 2. Device Joining via QR Code
**As a** user with a mobile device or another computer  
**I want** to scan the QR code  
**So that** I can join the clipboard sharing session  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Scanning the QR code opens the web application on the device
- [ ] The device automatically joins the existing session
- [ ] A confirmation message indicates successful joining
- [ ] Multiple devices can join the same session simultaneously
- [ ] Joined devices see the same session interface

### 3. Copy Text to Shared Clipboard
**As a** user on any joined device  
**I want** to copy text to the shared clipboard  
**So that** other devices in the session can access it  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A text input field is available for entering clipboard content
- [ ] A "Copy" button adds the text to the shared clipboard
- [ ] The text is immediately available to all devices in the session
- [ ] Success feedback is provided when text is copied
- [ ] Text length is limited to prevent abuse (e.g., 10KB max)
- [ ] Empty or whitespace-only text cannot be copied

### 4. Paste Text from Shared Clipboard
**As a** user on any joined device  
**I want** to paste the latest text from the shared clipboard  
**So that** I can use content copied by other devices  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A "Paste" button retrieves the latest clipboard text
- [ ] The retrieved text is displayed in a read-only area
- [ ] If no text is available, an appropriate message is shown
- [ ] The paste operation works for all devices in the session
- [ ] Text formatting is preserved where possible

### 5. Real-time Synchronization
**As a** user with multiple devices in a session  
**I want** clipboard updates to be synchronized in real-time  
**So that** I always see the latest content without manual refresh  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When text is copied on one device, other devices are notified
- [ ] The UI updates automatically to show new clipboard content
- [ ] Synchronization works within 2 seconds of the copy operation
- [ ] No manual refresh is required
- [ ] Connection status is indicated to users

### 6. Session Management
**As a** user  
**I want** clear session information and controls  
**So that** I understand the current state and can manage the session  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Current session ID is displayed
- [ ] Number of connected devices is shown
- [ ] Session expiry time is indicated
- [ ] Option to leave the session is available
- [ ] Option to create a new session is available

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery
**As a** user  
**I want** clear error messages and recovery options  
**So that** I can resolve issues and continue using the application  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Network errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Session expiry is clearly communicated
- [ ] Invalid session IDs show appropriate errors
- [ ] Connection loss attempts automatic reconnection
- [ ] All error states provide actionable guidance

### 8. Security and Privacy
**As a** user  
**I want** my clipboard data to be secure  
**So that** sensitive information is protected  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Session IDs are cryptographically secure and unpredictable
- [ ] Sessions automatically expire after inactivity
- [ ] No clipboard data is logged or persisted beyond session lifetime
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all communications
- [ ] No unauthorized access to sessions is possible

### 9. Cross-Device Compatibility
**As a** user with various devices  
**I want** the application to work on all my devices  
**So that** I can use it regardless of platform  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Works on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Works on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] QR code scanning works from mobile camera apps
- [ ] UI is responsive and usable on all screen sizes
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly on mobile devices

### 10. Performance and Reliability
**As a** user  
**I want** the application to be fast and reliable  
**So that** my workflow is not interrupted  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Page loads in under 3 seconds
- [ ] Copy/paste operations complete in under 1 second
- [ ] Application handles at least 10 concurrent sessions
- [ ] Each session supports at least 5 connected devices
- [ ] 99% uptime during normal operation
- [ ] Graceful degradation during high load
